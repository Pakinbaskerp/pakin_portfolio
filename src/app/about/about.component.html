          Hi, I’m <strong>Pakin</strong> — a passionate Software Developer fluent in English and Tamil. I love building clean, modular, and high-performance systems. Whether it's designing APIs, scaling databases, or architecting backends, I bring engineering clarity and sharp focus to everything I do.

          Outside of code, I enjoy long tech documentaries, sipping filter coffee while debugging, and working on projects that serve real people. My interests include <strong>system design, scalable APIs, and automation tools</strong>. I believe great software is as much about empathy and clarity as it is about logic.

          I'm currently working on improving my skills in <strong>Clean Architecture, Redis internals, and system observability</strong>. I believe a good developer not only writes code but also understands how it runs in production. My dream is to build tools that empower developers to be more efficient and creative.
